# In Angry, Drunken Dwarves, you are an angry, drunken dwarf. Why are you so angry? Who knows. But you've decided to take your aggression out on other dwarves, by dropping gems on their heads. Lots of gems. angrydd is a member of the classic "falling blocks" puzzle game family, similar to the Capcom game Puzzle Fighter. The goal of the game is to build large gems by matching up colors, then break them, raining more gems down onto your opponent. The first person whose field fills up, loses. angrydd has seven playable characters, six levels of AI, secret game modes and characters, and an original soundtrack.

# Crack Attack is an OpenGL puzzle game similar to the Super Nintendo game "Tetris Attack". Slowly, your stack of colored blocks grows from the bottom, and you've got to make sure it never reaches the top. If it does, you lose. To eliminate blocks from the stack, line up at least three of one color, horizontally or vertically. Once you do, those blocks disappear, and put off slightly your inevitable demise.

# Crack Attack is very slow without hardware acceleration. For Xorg users, this means you want DRI.

# Cuyo, named after a Spanish relative adjective, shares with tetris that things fall down and how to navigate them. When enough "of the same type" come "together", they explode. The goal of each level is to blow special "stones" away, you start with. But what "of the same type" and "together" means, varies with the levels.

# Frozen-Bubble is a clone of the popular "Puzzle Bobble" game, in which you attempt to shoot bubbles into groups of the same color to cause them to pop.

# Players compete as penguins and must use the arrow keys to aim a colored bubble at groups of bubbles. The objective is to clear all the bubbles off the screen before a bubble passes below a line at the bottom.

# It features 100 single-player levels, a two-player mode, music and striking graphics. A level editor is also included to allow players to create and play their own levels.

# Galois is a computer game of the "falling blocks" type, but with unique features. Unlike most other games of that type, it is not limited to blocks made of four two-dimensional, square bricks: you can choose among several different brick shapes, blocks composed of more or fewer bricks, and even between two- and three-dimensional games.

# The game is played with YOU at the bottom of the screen. At the top is a random assortment of colored shapes ("gems"). As time goes on, more gems appear at the very top of the screen, pushing the rest downwards. The game is over when the gems reach the bottom.

# It's your job to keep the screen from filling up. You do this by "grabbing" gems from the top of the screen, carrying them around, if need be, and "throwing" them back up.

# If, when you throw some gems back up, you create a "match" of 3 or more gems in a vertical column, they disappear (with a cool little explosion). At this point, if there are any "matches" of the same gem to the left or right of this column, they disappear too! And so on. This is great for cool chain-reactions! You also get more points for the more gems that disappear in a match. (Matching four gives as many points as matching three twice, for example.)

# Netris is a free, networked variant of Tetris.

# One-player mode is a tad boring at the moment because it never gets any faster and there's no scoring. This will be rectified at some point.

# Two players can play against each other. If you fill two or three lines with one piece your opponent gets respectively one or two unfilled lines at the bottom of his screen. If you fill even four lines with one piece your opponent will get four unfilled lines.

# This version at least partially supports robots. You can find the protocol description in the documentation and a sample robot in the examples.

It has been tested with xterm, rxvt, the Linux console, and kermit running on MS-DOS over a serial link, but it should work on any terminal capable of interpreting ANSI escape sequences for cursor addressing, character set selection, and color attributes.

# As the title suggests, this is a clone of the original tetris game written by Alexey Pajitnov, Dmitry Pavlovsky, and Vadim Gerasimov.

# The game is as close to the original as possible, but there are a few differences. Nevertheless, it's probably the closest to the original that you'll ever find in the UNIX world...

# Vitetris is a terminal-based Tetris game. It can be played by one or two players, over the network or on the same keyboard.

# Vitetris comes with more features and options than might be expected from a simple text mode game. Full input control, customizable appearance, netplay where both players can choose difficulty (level and height) -- unless you must have sound (or just don't like Tetris), you won't be disappointed.

# Rotation, scoring, levels and speed should resemble the early Tetris games by Nintendo, with the addition of a short lock delay which makes it possible to play at higher levels. (It does not make it possible to prevent the piece from ever locking by abusing lock delay resets.)
